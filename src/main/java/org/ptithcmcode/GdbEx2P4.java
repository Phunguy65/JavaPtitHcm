 * <p>
 * Create class SavingsAccount. 
 * Use a static variable annualInterestRate to store the annual interest rate for all account holders. Each object of the class contains a private instance variable 
 * savingsBalance indicating the amount the saver currently has on deposit. 
 * Provide method calculateMonthlyInterest to calculate the monthly interest by multiplying the savingsBalance by annualInterestRate divided by 12 this interest should be added to savingsBalance.
 * Provide a static method modifyInterestRate that sets the annualInterestRate to a new value. 
 * 
 * <p>
 * Write a program to test class SavingsAccount. Instantiate two savingsAccount objects, saver1 and saver2, with balances of $2000.00 and $3000.00, respectively. Set annualInterestRate to 4%, then calculate the monthly interest and print the new balances for both savers. Then set the annualInterestRate to 5%, calculate the next monthâ€™s interest and print the new balances for both savers.
